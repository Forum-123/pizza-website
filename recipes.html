                        <h6>Method</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml tepid water. Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. Dissolve the yeast in 2 tbsp water and mix this and 15g of salt through the dough. Cover with cling film and leave somewhere warm to double in size for a few hours. For a sourer flavour, leave in the fridge for at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs – the longer you leave it the sourer it will be.</li>
                            <li>When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four. Roll into balls and leave to rest, covered with a tea towel or cling film for another hour.</li>
                            <li>Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt, then either scrunch everything together with your fingers for a chunky sauce or blitz with a stick blender if you want it smooth. Tie the basil stalks together, bruise with the back of a knife and place in the sauce. Leave the sauce at room temperature until needed.</li>
                            <li>To make the pizza, heat a grill to its highest setting and get a heavy frying pan. On a floured surface push and stretch one of the balls of dough out into a circle roughly the same size as the frying pan. Slip the round onto a floured baking sheet and top with a quarter of the sauce, a scattering of cheese, a few basil leaves and a quarter of the mozzarella.</li>
                            <li>Get the pan very hot and carefully slide the pizza onto it. Cook for 2 mins, then put the pan under the grill for another 2 mins until the sides are puffed up and the cheese has melted. Lift onto a board, drizzle with a little olive oil if you like, then cut into wedges and serve while you make the next one.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The night before pizza-making day, make the poolish by mixing together the flour and yeast with 150ml of lukewarm water. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave overnight. It should be very bubbly by the morning.</li>
                            <li>To make the dough, tip the poolish, flour, olive oil and 275ml of lukewarm water into a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Mix on low for 5 minutes until the flour is fully incorporated. Alternatively, mix together in a large bowl really well with clean hands until there is no unmixed flour left</li>
                            <li>Leave for 20 minutes, then tip in the salt with 2 tbsp more lukewarm water and mix for another 5 minutes – it should be a smooth, combined dough that has started to come away from the sides of the bowl. Alternatively, use clean, wet hands to stretch, pull and knead the dough for 10 minutes on a floured worksurface until it becomes a stretchy, single piece of dough.</li>
                            <li>Tip into a lightly oiled bowl and leave, covered with a clean tea towel, to prove for 3-4 hours, giving it a stretch and fold every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours (gently pull up one side of the dough with wet hands and fold it over the rest of the dough. Turn 90 degrees and repeat three times). Leave the dough until nearly doubled in size and is really bubbly.</li>
                            <li>Turn out onto a floured worksurface and divide into four equal pieces. Shape into four tight balls and at this point you have two choices: 1) leave the dough at room temperature for another 2 hours, lightly dusted with flour and covered with a clean tea towel, after which it is ready to cook; or 2) put the balls into a flat container or onto a plate, sprinkle with flour, then cover and chill for up to 24 hours. Remove from the fridge 2 hours before cooking to reach room temperature.</li>
                            <li>For the sauce, tip the tomatoes, tomato purée, sugar, pepper and some seasoning into a food processor. Whizz until smoothish. Add the vinegar, mix and check the seasoning.</li>
                            <li>To shape the pizzas, sprinkle a chopping board with the polenta/flour mix, take one of the dough balls, sprinkle liberally with more polenta/flour, then gently use your fist to spread the ball wider, taking care not to push on the very edge of the ball. Gently press and stretch the dough, turning it so that it becomes an even circle roughly the same size as the base of the frying pan.</li>
                            <li>Heat a large, non-stick, ovenproof frying pan over a high heat and heat the grill to high, with a rack at the top. Once the frying pan is very hot, carefully slide the dough circle into the pan and, working quickly, spoon on some of the tomato sauce, swirling it to the edge, tear over some of the mozzarella and place the pepperoni slices on top. Cook on the hob, carefully lifting the base with a spatula every few minutes to check that the dough has crisped up and charred in places. Put the pan under the grill and cook until puffed, bubbling and charred. Carefully slide the pizza out of the pan, sprinkle over the basil leaves and drizzle with oil. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.</li>

                        <h6>Method</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/gas 9 (full whack) or as hot as it will go. Place 2 large baking trays in to heat up.</li>
                            <li>Place the flour in a large bowl with a small pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the yoghurt. Mix well with a spatula until you can’t move it anymore, then use your clean hands to form it into a dough. Turn onto a board and knead for a few minutes until smooth. Plop it back into the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave to one side while you make your sauce.</li>
                            <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic and place in a medium pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook for 1 minute, then pour in the tomatoes. Use a potato masher to squash everything down to make a lovely smooth sauce. Cook for 10 minutes, or until thickened, then tear in most of the basil, season to perfection and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Now for the fun bit. Place your dough on a flour-dusted surface and divide into 8 pieces. Line up all your toppings so they’re ready to go: finely chop the red chilli and grate the Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. Pick the remaining basil leaves (and finely chop, if you like), thinly slice the mushrooms. and tear the ham into small pieces. Roll the pieces of dough into thin rounds, stacking them up between sheets of greaseproof paper as you go to stop them sticking.</li>
                            <li>Carefully remove the baking trays from the oven (get an adult to help you with this bit!). Transfer your pizza bases to the hot trays and, working quickly, spoon over the tomato sauce over each base, spreading out with a spoon. Tear over the mozzarella and add your favourite toppings. Pop the trays back in the oven and cook for 10 minutes, or until the bases are crispy and the cheese is bubbling. Slice into triangles and serve with a side salad.</li>
